##Why it is important to choose a license
It is important to choose a license when creating Open Source software, becuase with a license you are guaranteed freedoms throught the license.  Without having a license, the software is not Open Source, because they are not contractually obligated to follow the standards set by the license.

##Not Using a Project with a License
When choosing a project to work on or use, if it is marketed as Open Source it is necessary to make sure it has a license.  This is because without a license the software is not truly free.  Free meaning that you are guaranteed the rights to modify and distribute as you see fit.

##Gopher
I agree with the claim that Gopher failed because of a lack of open source, in the early days of the internet, a large userbase was needed for it to get off the ground.  With Gopher charging licensing fee's this probably turned many people off of buying in early to something without much support or community.  I believe this is why Gopher failed.

##Linux Licensing
Linux uses the GPL v2 license because it takes a copy-left approach to development and distribution.  The important factor being that if someone modifies the software, and they want to distribute it, they have to follow the same standards as the original version.  So if they modify it and distribute it, they must also make their software Open Source throught the GPL v2 license.

##Different Licenses for Different Needs
The three different licenses all serve different purposes for software.  GPL is good if you want to build a community of developers for your project.  This is because if you make a change to the source code you have make them available under the license.  This allows for the greater good to benefit, as people adding and modifying code just adds more features for you.  LGPL is good if you are a developer, because you can add your work to a library and people can use the library without having to make their software under the license as well.  So if you are a developer you can use an LGPL licensed library in your software and not have it be LGPL licensed.  The Apache license is good if you are a company as it still allows for patents to affect your code while still being open source.

##Project
The project I am thinking about making will be a tool for a game that adds functionallity to that game that is not supported in the game by default.  The users will be other people who play the game.  I will use a GPL license which will hopefully cause other developers who play the game to contribute to the project.  This will cause the project to grow and reach new users who can potentailly also contribute.  This tool will hopefully help other users enjoy the experience of the game more or add functionallity that was not there before.
